# Generate_random_color

```javascript
This JavaScript code snippet generates a random RGB color. RGB (Red, Green, Blue) is a color model widely used in digital devices and web design. Each color component (red, green, blue) is represented by an integer value ranging from 0 to 255. By combining different intensities of these three primary colors, a wide range of colors can be produced.
